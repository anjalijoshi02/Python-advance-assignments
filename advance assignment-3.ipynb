    "- An abstract superclass can be considered as a blueprint for other classes.\n",
    "- It allows you to create a set of methods that must be created within any child classes built from the abstract class.\n",

    "When a Class statement's top level contains a basic assignment statement, it is usually treated as a class attribute or class level variable.\n",

    "If the derived/child class has __init__ method, it won't inherit the __init__ method of the parent class.    \n",
    "In other words, a child class's __init__ method overrides the parent method and thus we need to call the parent class's __init__ method manually using super() method. "

    "A Variable which is defined inside a function is local to that function. It is accesible from the point at which it is defined until the end of the function, and exists for as long as the function is existing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similary a variable inside a class also has a local variable scope. Variables which are defined in the class body (but outside all methods) are called as class level variables or class attributes. They can be referenced by there bare names within the same scope, but they can also be accessed from outside this scope if we use the attribute access operator (.). on a class or an instance of the class."
