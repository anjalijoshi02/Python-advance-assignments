    "__Ans:__ The differences between Text Files and Binary Files are:\n",
    "\n",
    "__Text files__ are special subset of binary files that are used to store human readable characters as a rich text document or plain text document. Text files also store data in sequential bytes but bits in text file represents characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Binary files__ are those typical files that store data in the form of sequence of bytes grouped into eight bits or sometimes sixteen bits. These bits represent custom data and such files can store multiple types of data (images, audio, text, etc) under a single file."
